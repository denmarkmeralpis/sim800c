```

## Overview

```ruby
require 'sim800c'

port_path = Sim800c.find_port # /dev/ttyUSB0
client = Sim800c::Client.new(port_path, baud: 9600)

# Send SMS
client.send_message("+639123456789", "Hello from SIM800C!")

# Store and then send SMS
client.save_and_send_message("+639123456789", "Stored first, sent later")

# List of all messages
puts client.list_messages.all

# Check signal quality
puts client.signal_quality.info

# Get battery info
puts client.device.battery_info

# Delete message by index
client.delete_message.by_index(1)

# ...and more
```

## Usage

### Message Listing
```ruby
messages = client.list_messages

messages.all    # => All messages
messages.unread # => => Only unread messages
messages.read   # => Sent messages
messages.unsent # => Unsent messages
messages.sent   # => Sent messages
```

### Message Deletion

```ruby
deleter = client.delete_message

deleter.by_index(1)              # => delete specific message by index
deleter.all                      # => delete all messages
deleter.all_read                 # => delete all read messages
deleter.all_read_and_sent        # => delete all read and sent messages
deleter.all_read_sent_and_unsent # => same with .all

```

### Signal Quality

```ruby
signal = client.signal_quality

signal.info   # => { rssi: 25, bars: 5, strength: 'Excellent' }
signal.rssi   # => 25
```

### Device / Battery Info

```ruby
device = client.device

device.battery_info
# => {
#      charge_status: 0,
#      battery_level: 100,
#      voltage_mv: 4367,
#      charge_status_label: "Not charging"
#    }
```

### Storage Info

```ruby
client.storage_info
# => [{
#       storage_type: "read_write",
#       memory: "SM",
#       used: 2,
#       total: 30
#    }]
```

### TODOs:
- Add HTTP/TCP support
- Enable incoming SMS handling (AT+CNMI)
- Command retries with timeout/backoff

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.
